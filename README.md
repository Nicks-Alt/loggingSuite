## *Weekly Goal(Goal Management):*
- Along with the startup check for Daily Objectives, the program will also check to see if you entered a goal for the current week. If no goal is available for the week, the program will ask you to enter one. Program execution will not be available until goal is entered.
- After entering your goal, it will be available to be viewed on the main form in a listbox named "Goal Management".

## *Shutdown Sequence/Reminder to do logs:*

- The amount of minutes and seconds will be shown to the user on the main form until they press the *ABORT SHUTDOWN* button.

## *The Logging Suite & Avast Anti-Virus*
- Since avast is a very sensitive Anti-Virus, it will sometimes quarentine the .exe as a false positive. In order to add an exception for Avast, do the following:
  1) Expand the Windows Task Bar context menu to locate the avast icon and right click. Select the <b>Virus Chest</b> option.<br>
